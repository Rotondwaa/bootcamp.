   <p>My name is Ramadwa Rotondwa and I am one of the few females who believes in technology.<br> 
    I've got my higher certificate
    and a degree in Information Technology.I also have international certificates<br>
    such as CompTia A+ and N+.I've been in different kind of fields when it comes to tech world,<br>
     reason being I am a woman who loves to explore technology in all aspect.<br>
    As we all know, technology keeps on changing every now and
    then so basically we learn new things everyday.<br>
    I am currently in technical and networking world but coding also stole
    my heart.<br>
     I love to learn new things everyday and I believe that I am a fast learner,<br> 
     persistent, consistent and dedicated to what I set my heart to. During<br>
     my studies I learned the importance of being disciplined, completing my work<br>
     on time and to a high standard, and supporting other students on their work.
